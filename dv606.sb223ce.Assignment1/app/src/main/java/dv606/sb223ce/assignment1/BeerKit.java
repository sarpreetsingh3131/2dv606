                    "The aroma/taste reminded me of slow drip coffee from single origin coffee beans blended perfect with " +
                    "maple syrup. The body was perfect as it had a fuller month feel than a Kbs but not as full as a VR. ",

            "Phenomenal beer. So great. Looks like a classic imperial stout but with a rich brown, foamy head. The nose is of " +
                    "sweet amply syrup, with a more subtle coffee undertone. Kind of surprising given how strong of a coffee " +
                    "flavor their double shot has. The taste is more than expected. Definite maple, coffee, sweet and sticky. " +
                    "Nice think velvet body, but Sioux being syrupy. Without a doubt one of best 3 beers I've had the pleasure " +
                    "of trying. ",

            "Had this on opening day Feb 6, 2015 after waiting in line for 4.5 hrs in the pouring rain. It is a spectacular " +
                    "beer to have straight from the source. Although a very high abv it does not taste alcohol forward and is" +
                    " truly balanced with a good amount of hops on your tongue, a bit of grapefruit follow through and a floral" +
                    " scent. Had a great time drying off and warming up and 3 10oz pours along with some Elder and Blind Pig hit " +
                    "the spot. It is a special beer worth the effort.",

            "I was lucky enough to get some Heady Topper last week on a trip up to VT. I stood in line for two hours total at a " +
                    "couple of different places in Burlington and ended up with a little over a case, it was completely worth the" +
                    " wait. It is the most drinkable IPA I've ever tasted, very smooth, and as the can says it leaves you" +
                    " with \"wave after wave of hoppy goodness!\" Not to mention at 8% ABV one or two of these bad boys will leave" +
                    " feeling nice and hopped up. I only wish they would make more so more people could try this amazing beer!",

            "Pours like all TG stouts which nearly equates to motor oil. Of course the mouth feel will follow the pour which " +
                    "allows you to chew on the deliciousness that ensues. Scent is roasted coffee with chocolate and maple. Bit " +
                    "of booze in there as well. Flavor is something I've yet to find any other beer match between the coffee, " +
                    "maple, chocolate, molasses and balanced mouthfeel that lets you mull this beer over a bit. ",

            "Poured clear amber color into a pint glass with a persistent fluffy white head. The aroma was the star of this" +
                    " beer: a monstrous blast of fresh hops, citric and spicy. The flavor was initially overwhelming sharp " +
                    "hop bitterness. This faded to a pleasant biscuity malt flavor. Medium high carbonation was almost prickly" +

                    " Instead, it is an easy drinking beer that finishes clean and sweet, but short of sticky sweet, and with a" +
                    " hint of the citrus and spice of the hops. Overall, it is a fantastic IPA. ",

            "Swedish beer is fun to me because I can buy it at Systembolaget and anywhere else like 7-11, the later being of" +
                    " lower alcohol versions of the former. I only tried the lower alcohol version of this one, as there are " +
                    "other better Swedish beers to get in higher alcohol. Average in all ways, not really good but not bad " +
                    "either. Smells a bit of corn, all in all nothing special. Nevertheless I liked this beer and it served me" +
                    " well. I was still able to drink much with my friends, when I had a sore throat! It was very smooth in all" +
                    " ways. Take it for what it is and enjoy. Just a typical beer to drink and have a good time"
